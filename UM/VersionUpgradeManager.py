##  Regulates the upgrading of configuration from one application version to the
#   next.
#
#   The process of upgrading will take a look at all profiles, preferences and
#   machine instances and check their version numbers. If they are older than
#   the current version number of their respective type of file, an upgrade
#   route will be planned for it in order to upgrade the file to the current
#   version in as few conversions as possible.
#
#   To this end, the upgrade manager will maintain the shortest routes to the
#   current version for each of the types of profiles and each old version it
#   encounters. Once a shortest route is found, it is cached and can be re-used
#   for all nodes along this route. This minimises the extra start-up time
#   required for the conversions.
#
#   Old versions of the configuration are not deleted, but put in a folder next
#   to the current (upgraded) versions, where they are never loaded again unless
#   the user manually retrieves the files.
